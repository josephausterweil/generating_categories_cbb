<p>
Thanks for that! There is a category of geometric figures called
"<span class='category'></span>".&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like your last task, instead of showing you examples of
the <span class='category'></span> category, we would like to know what you think the <span class='category'></span>
category is.
</p>

<p>
You will now be given the chance to create examples of any size or color in order to show what you expect about the <span class='category'></span> category.&nbsp;&nbsp;
As before, you will be asked to produce <span id='ntrials'></span> <span id=category'></span> examples - they can be quite similar or quite different to each other, depending on what you think makes the most sense for the category.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each example needs to be unique, but the computer will let you know if you accidentally create a repeat.
