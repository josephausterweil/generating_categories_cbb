<p>
As it turns out, there is another category of geometric figures called "Beta".&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instead of showing you examples of the Beta category, we would like to know what you think is likely to be in the Beta category. 
</p>

<p>
You will now be given the chance to create examples of any size or color in order to show what you expect about the Beta category.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You will be asked to produce <span id='ntrials'></span> Beta examples - they can be quite similar or quite different to each other, depending on what you think makes the most sense for the category.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each example needs to be unique, but the computer will let you know if you accidentally create a repeat.
