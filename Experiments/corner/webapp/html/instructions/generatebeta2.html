<p>
Nice work! At this point, we would like you to generate <span id='ntrials'></span> examples of
the <span class='category'></span> category once more. Don't worry if you can't remember what you generated earlier -
this is not meant to be a test of memory. Instead, follow the instructions as provided earlier. Specifically, there is
another category of geometric figures called <span class='category'></span> and we would like to know what you think is likely to be in the <span class='category'></span> category. 
</p>

<p>
As before, you will now be given the chance to create examples of any size or color in order to show what you expect about the <span class='category'></span> category.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each example needs to be unique, but the computer will let you know if you accidentally create a repeat.

  document.getElementById('ntrials').innerHTML = generation.ntrials;
  var cats = document.getElementsByClassName('category')
  for (var i = 0; i < cats.length; ++i) {
  cats[i].innerHTML = generation.bcnames[generation.countbc];
