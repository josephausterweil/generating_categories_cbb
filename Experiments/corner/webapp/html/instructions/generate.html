<p>
As it turns out, there is another category of geometric figures called "<span class='category'></span>".&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instead of showing you examples of the <span class='category'></span> category, we would like to know what you think is likely to be in the <span class='category'></span> category. 
</p>

<p>
  You will now be given the chance to create examples of any <span class='dim1name'></span> or size in order to show what you expect about the <span class='category'></span> category.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  You will be asked to produce <span id='ntrials'></span> <span id='category'></span> examples - they can be quite similar or quite different to each other, depending on what you think makes the most sense for the category.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Each example needs to be unique, but the computer will let you know if you accidentally create a repeat.
