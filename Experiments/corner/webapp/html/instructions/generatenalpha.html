  <p>
	There is another category of geometric figures that are
	NOT from the Alpha category.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of
	showing you examples, we would like
	to know what you think is likely to NOT be in Alpha
	category.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	You will now be given the chance to create examples of any size or color in order to show what you expect would NOT
	be in the Alpha category.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be asked to produce <span id='ntrials'></span> examples - they can be
	quite similar or quite different to each other, depending on what you think makes the most sense for this
	category.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each example needs to be unique, but the computer will let you know if you accidentally create
	a repeat.
