<p class = "consent_title">DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH</p>
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study about how people learn and/or create new concepts by providing experience with the concepts. You have been asked to participate because we are creating a computational model of how people learn and construct new concepts.</p>
<p>The purpose of the research is to validate the computational model to understand how people learn and create concepts better, as well as create new machine learning methods that learn and behave in a more human-like manner.</p>
<p>This study will include native-English speakers who are 18 years old or older. The experiment will be conducted through Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>

For example, you might be asked to indicate the category membership of objects you have never seen before, or fill-in properties for category members that have missing features. Your participation will require 1 session lasting between 10 and 60 minutes total.
