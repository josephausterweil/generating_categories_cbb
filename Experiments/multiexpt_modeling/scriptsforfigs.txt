Table 3: print_gs_results.py
    Note this prints the overall best fitting parameters for all participants for the data set and model involved. chtc_gs_best_params_corner.p has the one for Table 3 (corner is an alias for Experiment 3). The Negated models are alternatives we were exploring for future modeling development that did not make it into the current article.
